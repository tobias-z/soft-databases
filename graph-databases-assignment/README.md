## Introduction

This project was intended to make us learn about graph databases, and how to work with them in practice.

The assignment can be found [here](./documents/assignment.pdf)

## Business Case

The business case is to provide a way to view pages and their links.
We should also be able to figure out which pages are important.

## Data

The selected data is the `Stanford web graph` which is a graph of pages relevant to Stanford University.

The data was found [here](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Stanford.html) and the zip containing the data can be found [here](./documents/web-Stanford.csv.tar.gz)

The data was modified into a CSV file, and is structured like this:

```
FromNodeId,ToNodeId
1,6548
1,15409
6548,57031
15409,13102
2,17794
2,25202
2,53625
2,54582
2,64930
```
